# Programming ESP32-C3 with Rust
Examples with wiring diagrams for using some sensors with ESP32-C3, programmed with Rust
![ESP32-C3 with Rust Logo](./ESP32-C3.png)

## Materials Needed
- ESP32-C3 (I bought [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805941172619.html) and [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805870348476.html))
- USB Cable to connect the ESP32-C3 to your computer. You can use a USB-A to USB-C cable or a USB-C to USB-C cable, they both work.
- Project-specific materials

## Try out the code
- Clone this repo
- Install Rust
- You may need to install some Rust stuff for ESP32-C3
- Plug in your ESP32-C3
- Make sure you have the permissions to access ESP32-C3 (`/dev/ttyACM0`)
- `cd` to the directory you want to run
- `cargo run`
