# HC-SR04
Measure distance (cm) using a HC-SR04 sensor.

## Wiring Diagram
![Fritzing Bread Board](./Sketch_bb.svg)

### Note
- You can solder pins to the ESP32-C3 and place the ESP32-C3 on the breadboard, similar to how a Raspberry Pi Pico is usually used.

### Materials Needed
- HC-SR04
- Jumper wires

## TODO
- Someone with an actually working HC-SR04 sensor may have to tweak the code. My sensor stops working properly at distances >60cm
