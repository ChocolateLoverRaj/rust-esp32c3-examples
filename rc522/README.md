## rx gain values and distance
From my testing. The distances are not at what distance it's *reliable*. It's what distance does the card's id occasionally get read by the reader. So it's more of an upper bound to avoid making the reader too sensitive. 

| RxGain | Distance (cm) |
| ------ | ------------- |
| DB18   | 1.4           |
| DB23   | 2.9           |
| DB33   | 4.6           |
| DB38   | 5.7           |
| DB43   | 5.9           |
| DB48   | 6.9           |
